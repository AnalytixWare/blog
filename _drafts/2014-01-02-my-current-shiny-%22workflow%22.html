Well I have been using the excellent RStudio IDE for my Shiny development. But I have also been using Sublime Text 3 for editing HTML JavaScript and R code. In particular I find that there are features in Sublime Text that I just can't do without now!<div><br></div><div>What I like about Sublime Text:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Find a text in all files</div><div>2. Multiple editing - for quickly renaming all my variables and other nifty features</div><div>3. Find the file I need to work with quickly</div><div>4. Package Control</div><div>5. Enhance-R (R syntax highlighting)</div><div>6. Code snippets - define your own</div><div>7. Auto-format JavaScript and HTML</div><div><br></div>
